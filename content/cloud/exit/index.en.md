<div style="text-align: center;"><p>
People praise the cloud as carefree, with managed services easing every pain.<br/>
I say clouds are pig-butchering schemes, hundredfold markups with smug disdain.<br/>
Cyber landlords hold monopolies, hike the price, extract your vein.<br/>
They outsource ops, freeload on OSS, rent you servers, rebrand the game.<br/>
Everyone rushes to the cloud, burning cash like pouring rain.<br/>
Sky-high rentals can’t be borne; self-hosted OSS is still the sane.<br/>
Downcloud pioneers clear the way, shouldering doubt and market strain.<br/>
They see through fog to mountain tops because they walk the edge in pain.
</p></div><br>

“Cloud-first” became dogma; many developers only see through that lens. These essays use data and firsthand experience to explain both the value and the traps of public-cloud rentals—practical references in this era of “do more with less.”
