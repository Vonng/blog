  What a wonderful subject mathematics is

In the very center of humanity's rational world

An eternal ivory tower stands tall upon it

From the depths of the vast intuitive earth below

Rising straight to the vicinity of the chaotic heavens where dense clouds roll

Countless electric branches extend from this tower

Permeating through space, leaping upon water's surface.



Within the tower, there exists such a group of people

They ceaselessly chisel and carve, downward, upward

They are breaking through the mental barriers of induction and deduction

They are building theoretical halls that unify all things

That dark void in the center of heaven and earth awaits exploration

Though this journey stretches endlessly, the path is obstructed and long



Sometimes, a certain section of the ivory tower will have a small skylight carved out

The sages say: Let there be light!

In an instant, the space on that side of the world is pierced by arcs of wisdom, illuminated by sparks of negative entropy

Those who climb along the paths carved by predecessors

Whenever witnessing such magnificent and grand sights

Are always moved to tears.
