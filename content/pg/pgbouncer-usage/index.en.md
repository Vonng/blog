Pgbouncer is a lightweight database connection pool.

### Synopsis

```bash
pgbouncer [-d][-R][-v][-u user] <pgbouncer.ini>
pgbouncer -V|-h
```

### Description

**pgbouncer** is a PostgreSQL connection pooler. Any target application can connect to **pgbouncer** as if it were a PostgreSQL server, and **pgbouncer** will create connections to the actual server or reuse existing connections.

The purpose of **pgbouncer** is to reduce the performance impact of opening new PostgreSQL connections.

To avoid affecting connection pool transaction semantics, **pgbouncer** supports several types of pooling when switching connections:

- **Session pooling**

  The most polite method. When a client connects, a server connection will be assigned for the entire duration of the client connection. When the client disconnects, the server connection is returned to the pool. This is the default method.

- **Transaction pooling**

  A server connection is only assigned to a client for the duration of a transaction. When PgBouncer detects transaction end, the server connection is returned to the pool.

- **Statement pooling**

  The most aggressive mode. Server connections are immediately returned to the pool after query completion. Multi-statement transactions are not allowed in this mode as they would break.

The **pgbouncer** management interface is available through some new `SHOW` commands when connecting to the special 'virtual' database **pgbouncer**.

### Getting Started

Basic setup and usage:

1. Create a pgbouncer.ini file. See **pgbouncer(5)** for details. Simple example:

   ```ini
   [databases]
   template1 = host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=template1
   
   [pgbouncer]
   listen_port = 6543
   listen_addr = 127.0.0.1
   auth_type = md5
   auth_file = users.txt
   logfile = pgbouncer.log
   pidfile = pgbouncer.pid
   admin_users = someuser
   ```

2. Create `users.txt` file containing allowed users:

   ```bash
   "someuser" "same_password_as_in_server"
   ```

3. Launch **pgbouncer**:

   ```bash
   $ pgbouncer -d pgbouncer.ini
   ```

4. Have your application (or **psql**) connect to **pgbouncer** instead of directly to PostgreSQL server:

   ```bash
    psql -p 6543 -U someuser template1
   ```

5. Manage **pgbouncer** by connecting to the special admin database **pgbouncer** and issue `show help;` to start:

   ```bash
   $ psql -p 6543 -U someuser pgbouncer
   pgbouncer=# show help;
   NOTICE:  Console usage
   DETAIL:
     SHOW [HELP|CONFIG|DATABASES|FDS|POOLS|CLIENTS|SERVERS|SOCKETS|LISTS|VERSION]
     SET key = arg
     RELOAD
     PAUSE
     SUSPEND
     RESUME
     SHUTDOWN
   ```

6. If you modify pgbouncer.ini file, you can reload it with:

   ```bash
   pgbouncer=# RELOAD;
   ```

### Command Line Switches

| -d             | Run in background. Without it, the process runs in foreground. Note: Doesn't work on Windows, **pgbouncer** needs to run as a service. |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -R             | Do online restart. This means connect to running process, load open sockets from it, then use them. If no active process, boot normally. Note: Only works if OS supports Unix sockets and `unix_socket_dir` is not disabled in config. Doesn't work on Windows. TLS connections are not used, they are dropped. |
| -u user        | Switch to given user on startup.                             |
| -v             | Increase verbosity. Can be used multiple times.             |
| -q             | Be quiet - don't log to stdout. Note this doesn't affect logging verbosity, only that stdout is not used. For init.d scripts. |
| -V             | Show version.                                                   |
| -h             | Show brief help.                                               |
| --regservice   | Win32: register pgbouncer to run as Windows service. **service_name** config parameter value is used as the name to register. |
| --unregservice | Win32: unregister Windows service.                                   |

### Admin Console

Console is available by connecting normally to database **pgbouncer**:

```
$ psql -p 6543 pgbouncer
```

Only users listed in config parameters **admin_users** or **stats_users** are allowed to login to console. (Exception: when auth_mode=any, any user can login as stats_user.)

Additionally, when logged in via Unix socket and the client has the same Unix user UID as the running process, username **pgbouncer** is allowed to login without password.

### SHOW Commands

#### `SHOW STATS;`

Shows statistics.

| Field               | Description                      |

| `total_xact_count`  | Total number of SQL transactions |
| `total_query_count` | Total number of SQL queries      |
| `total_received`    | Total network traffic received (bytes) |
| `total_sent`        | Total network traffic sent (bytes) |
| `total_xact_time`   | Total time spent in transactions |
| `total_query_time`  | Total time spent in queries      |
| `total_wait_time`   | Total time spent waiting         |

#### SHOW POOLS;

A new connection pool is created for each (database, user) pair.

- database: Database name
- user: Username
- cl_active: Client connections linked to server connection and can process queries
- cl_waiting: Client connections that have sent queries but not yet gotten server connection
- sv_active: Server connections linked to client
- sv_idle: Server connections unused and immediately available for client queries
- sv_used: Server connections idle longer than server_check_delay, so need to run server_check_query before they can be used
- sv_tested: Server connections currently running server_reset_query or server_check_query
- sv_login: Server connections currently in login process
- maxwait: How long the first (oldest) client in queue has been waiting, in seconds. If it starts increasing, the current connection pool can't handle requests fast enough. Cause could be server overload or **pool_size** setting too small
- pool_mode: Connection pooling mode being used

#### SHOW LISTS;

Shows following internal information in columns (not rows):

- databases: Database count
- users: User count  
- pools: Pool count
- free_clients: Free client count
- used_clients: Used client count
- login_clients: Client count in **login** state
- free_servers: Free server count
- used_servers: Used server count

#### SHOW USERS;

- name: Username
- pool_mode: User's overridden pool_mode, NULL if using default

#### SHOW DATABASES;

- name: Name of configured database entry
- host: Host pgbouncer connects to
- port: Port pgbouncer connects to  
- database: Actual database name pgbouncer connects to
- force_user: When user is part of connection string, connection between pgbouncer and PostgreSQL is forced to given user, regardless of client user
- pool_size: Maximum number of server connections
- pool_mode: Database's overridden pool_mode, NULL if using default

#### SHOW FDS;

Internal command - shows list of fds used with accompanying internal state.

When connected user uses username "pgbouncer", connected via Unix socket and has same UID as running process, actual fds are passed over connection. This mechanism is used for online restart. Note: Doesn't work on Windows.

This command also blocks internal event loop, so shouldn't be used while PgBouncer is in use.

- fd: File descriptor numeric value
- task: One of **pooler**, **client**, or **server**
- user: User of connection using this FD
- database: Database of connection using this FD
- addr: IP address of connection using FD, or **unix** if using unix socket
- port: Port of connection using FD
- cancel: Cancel key for this connection
- link: Corresponding server/client fd. NULL if idle

#### SHOW CONFIG;

Shows current configuration settings, one per line, with following fields:

- key: Configuration variable name
- value: Configuration value
- changeable: **yes** or **no**, shows whether runtime variable is changeable. If **no**, variable can only be changed at startup

#### SHOW DNS_HOSTS;

Shows hostnames in DNS cache.

- hostname: Hostname
- ttl: Seconds until next lookup
- addrs: Comma-separated list of addresses

#### SHOW DNS_ZONES

Shows DNS zones in cache.

- zonename: Zone name
- serial: Current serial number  
- count: Hostnames belonging to this zone

### Process Control Commands

#### `PAUSE [db];`

PgBouncer tries to disconnect all servers, first waiting for all queries to complete. Command doesn't return until all queries complete. Use during database restart. If database name provided, only that database is paused.

#### `DISABLE db;`

Reject all new client connections on given database.

#### `ENABLE db;`

Allow new client connections after previous **DISABLE** command.

#### `KILL db;`

Immediately drop all client and server connections on given database.

#### `SUSPEND;`

All socket buffers are flushed and PgBouncer stops listening for data on them. Command doesn't return until all buffers are empty. Use during PgBouncer online restart.

#### `RESUME [db];`

Resume work from previous **PAUSE** or **SUSPEND** command.

#### `SHUTDOWN;`

PgBouncer process will exit.

#### `RELOAD;`

PgBouncer process will reload its configuration file and update changeable settings.

### Signals

- SIGHUP: Reload config. Same as issuing **RELOAD;** command on console.
- SIGINT: Safe shutdown. Same as issuing **PAUSE;** and **SHUTDOWN;** on console.
- SIGTERM: Immediate shutdown. Same as issuing **SHUTDOWN;** on console.

### Libevent Settings

From libevent documentation:

```
Support for epoll, kqueue, devpoll, poll or select can be disabled by setting 
the environment variables EVENT_NOEPOLL, EVENT_NOKQUEUE, EVENT_NODEVPOLL, 
EVENT_NOPOLL or EVENT_NOSELECT respectively.

By setting the environment variable EVENT_SHOW_METHOD, libevent displays the 
kernel notification method it uses.
```
