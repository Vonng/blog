The annual PostgreSQL major version release is here! What surprises does PostgreSQL 17 bring us this time?

In this major version release announcement, the PostgreSQL global community has finally come clean — **Sorry, no more pretending** — "**PostgreSQL is now the world's most advanced open-source database and has become the preferred open-source database for organizations of all sizes**." While not naming names explicitly, the official statement has come infinitely close to declaring "overthrowing top commercial databases" (Oracle).

[![news.webp](news.webp)](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-17-released-2936/)

In my early-year article "[PostgreSQL is Eating the Database World](/pg/pg-eat-db-world)," I argued that **extensibility** is PostgreSQL's unique core advantage.
I'm delighted to see that this point became the focus and consensus of the PostgreSQL community in just six months, fully reflected in [PGCon.Dev 2024](/pg/pgcondev-2024/) and this PostgreSQL 17 release.

Regarding new features, I previously covered them in "[PostgreSQL 17 Beta1 Released! The Toothpaste Tube Burst!](/pg/pg-17-beta1)," so I won't repeat them here.
This major version has many new features, but what impressed me most is that PostgreSQL managed to double write throughput again on top of [already formidable performance](/pg/pg-performence) — **simply and powerfully impressive**.

But beyond specific features, I believe the biggest change in the PostgreSQL community occurred in **mindset and spirit** — in this release announcement, PostgreSQL removed the qualifier "relational" from its original slogan "world's most advanced open-source relational database," directly becoming "world's most advanced open-source database."
And in the final "About PostgreSQL" section, it states: "PostgreSQL's feature set, advanced capabilities, extensibility, security, and stability now match or exceed top commercial databases." So I think the "open-source" qualifier might soon be dropped as well, becoming "**the world's most advanced database**."

This PostgreSQL beast has awakened — it's no longer the peaceful, non-competitive entity it once was. Its spirit has completely transformed into an aggressive, progressive stance — it's psychologically prepared and mobilized to take over and conquer the entire database world.
Countless capital has also flooded into the PostgreSQL ecosystem, with [PostgreSQL startups taking almost all the new money in database funding](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fi_p3tTZTnwP5XDJrkVbQw). PostgreSQL is destined to become the "Linux kernel" that unifies the database world, and DBMS disputes may internalize into PostgreSQL distribution wars in the future. Let's wait and see.

## Original: PostgreSQL 17 Release Announcement

The PostgreSQL [Global Development Group](https://www.postgresql.org/) today officially (2024-09-26) announced the release of [PostgreSQL 17](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/release-17.html), the latest version of the world's most advanced open-source database.

> Note: Yes, the "relational" qualifier has been removed — it's now the world's most advanced open-source database

PostgreSQL 17 builds on decades of open-source development, continuously improving performance and scalability while adapting to emerging patterns of data access and storage.
This [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresql.org/) release brings significant overall performance improvements, such as a complete overhaul of VACUUM memory management, storage access optimizations, high-concurrency workload improvements, bulk loading and export acceleration, and index query execution improvements.
PostgreSQL 17 features capabilities that benefit both new workloads and critical core systems, such as: the new SQL/JSON `JSON_TABLE` command improves developer experience; while logical replication improvements simplify management burden for high-availability architectures and major version upgrades.

PostgreSQL core team member Jonathan Katz stated: "PostgreSQL 17 demonstrates how the global open-source community collaborates to build and improve functionality, helping users at different stages of their database journey." "Whether it's improvements for large-scale database operations or new features based on excellent developer experience, PostgreSQL 17 will provide you with a better data management experience."

PostgreSQL is an innovative data management system known for reliability, robustness, and extensibility. Benefiting from over 25 years of open-source development by the global developer community, **it has become the preferred open-source relational database for organizations of all types**.


--------

## Comprehensive System Performance Improvements

PostgreSQL's [`vacuum`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/routine-vacuuming.html) process is crucial for healthy system operation, but vacuum operations consume server instance resources. PostgreSQL 17 introduces a new vacuum internal memory structure that reduces memory consumption to 1/20th of the original. This not only improves vacuum speed but also reduces shared resource usage, freeing up more available resources for user workloads.

PostgreSQL 17 also continues optimizing performance at the I/O layer. Due to improvements in write-ahead log ([`WAL`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/wal-intro.html)) handling, high-concurrency workloads can see **write throughput improvements of up to two times**. Additionally, the new streaming I/O interface accelerates sequential scans (reading all data in a table) and [`ANALYZE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-analyze.html) updating planner statistics.

PostgreSQL 17 also improves query execution performance. For `IN` clause queries using [B-tree](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/indexes-types.html#INDEXES-TYPES-BTREE) indexes (PostgreSQL's default index method), performance has improved. Additionally, [BRIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/brin.html) indexes now support parallel construction.
PostgreSQL 17 made several query planning improvements, including optimizations for `NOT NULL` constraints and improved handling of CTEs ([`WITH`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/queries-with.html) queries). In this release, SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) acceleration is more widely applied, such as using `AVX-512` instructions in the [`bit_count`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-bitstring.html) function.


--------

## Further Enhanced Developer Experience

PostgreSQL was [the first relational database to add JSON support](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-92-released-1415/) (2012), and PostgreSQL 17 further completes the SQL/JSON standard implementation. The [`JSON_TABLE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-SQLJSON-TABLE) feature is now available in PostgreSQL 17 — allowing developers to convert JSON data to standard PostgreSQL tables.
PostgreSQL 17 now supports SQL/JSON standard [constructor functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-CREATION-TABLE) (`JSON`, `JSON_SCALAR`, `JSON_SERIALIZE`) and [query functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-json.html#SQLJSON-QUERY-FUNCTIONS) (`JSON_EXISTS`, `JSON_QUERY`, `JSON_VALUE`), providing developers with more ways to interact with JSON data.
This release adds more [`jsonpath` expressions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-SQLJSON-PATH-OPERATORS), focusing on converting JSON data to native PostgreSQL data types, including numeric, boolean, string, and date/time types.

PostgreSQL 17 adds more functionality to [`MERGE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-merge.html) (conditional UPDATE), including the `RETURNING` clause and the ability to update [views](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-createview.html).
Additionally, PostgreSQL 17 strengthens bulk loading and export capabilities. For example, when using the [`COPY`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-copy.html) command to export large amounts of data, performance improves by up to two times. When source and target encodings match, `COPY` performance also improves, and the `COPY` command includes a new `ON_ERROR` option that allows import to continue when insertion errors occur.

This release also expands management capabilities for partitioned data and data distributed across remote PostgreSQL instances. PostgreSQL 17 supports using identity columns and `EXCLUDE` constraints on [partitioned tables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/ddl-partitioning.html).
The PostgreSQL foreign data wrapper ([`postgres_fdw`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/postgres-fdw.html)) for executing queries on remote PostgreSQL instances can now push down `EXISTS` and `IN` subqueries to remote servers for more efficient processing.

PostgreSQL 17 also includes a built-in, platform-independent, immutable collation provider to ensure collation immutability and provides sorting semantics similar to the `C` collation but using `UTF-8` encoding instead of `SQL_ASCII`. Using this new collation provider ensures your text queries return the same sorting results regardless of where PostgreSQL runs.

## Logical Replication Improvements for High Availability and Major Version Upgrades

In many use cases, [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/logical-replication.html) is used for real-time data transmission.
However, before version 17, users wanting to perform major version upgrades had to first drop logical replication slots and needed to re-synchronize data to subscribers after upgrades.
Starting with PostgreSQL 17, users no longer need to drop logical replication slots first, thus simplifying the major version upgrade process when using logical replication.

PostgreSQL 17 now includes failover capabilities for logical replication, making it more reliable when deployed in high-availability environments.
Additionally, PostgreSQL 17 introduces the command-line tool [`pg_createsubscriber`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/app-pgcreatesubscriber.html) for converting physical standby servers to new logical standby servers.


--------

## More Security and Operations Management Options

PostgreSQL 17 further expands user management capabilities throughout the database system lifecycle. PostgreSQL provides a new TLS option `sslnegotiation` that allows users to perform direct TLS handshakes when using [ALPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-Layer_Protocol_Negotiation) (registered as `postgresql` in the ALPN directory).
PostgreSQL 17 also adds the [predefined role](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/predefined-roles.html) `pg_maintain`, granting regular users permission to perform maintenance operations.

PostgreSQL's built-in backup tool [`pg_basebackup`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/app-pgbasebackup.html) now supports incremental backups and adds the command-line utility [`pg_combinebackup`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/app-pgcombinebackup.html) for rebuilding full backups.
Additionally, `pg_dump` adds a new `--filter` option allowing you to select which objects to include when generating dump files.

PostgreSQL 17 also enhances monitoring and analysis capabilities. The [`EXPLAIN`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-explain.html) command now shows local block read/write I/O timing and includes two new options: `SERIALIZE` and `MEMORY`, which can show data conversion time for network transmission and memory usage.
PostgreSQL 17 now also reports [index VACUUM progress](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/progress-reporting.html#VACUUM-PROGRESS-REPORTING)
and adds the new system view [`pg_wait_events`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/view-pg-wait-events.html), which when used with the `pg_stat_activity` view provides deeper insight into why active sessions are waiting.
