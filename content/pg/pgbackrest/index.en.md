## Preface

pgBackRest aims to provide a simple, reliable, easily scalable PostgreSQL backup and recovery system.

pgBackRest doesn't depend on traditional backup tools like tar and rsync, but implements all backup functions internally and uses a custom protocol to communicate with remote systems. Eliminating dependencies on tar and rsync allows for better handling of database-specific backup issues. The custom remote protocol provides more flexibility and limits the types of connections required to perform backups, thus improving security.

pgBackRest [v2.01](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest/releases/tag/release/2.01) is the current stable version. Release notes are available on the releases page.

pgBackRest aims to be a simple, reliable backup and recovery system that can seamlessly scale to the largest databases and workloads.

pgBackRest doesn't rely on traditional backup tools like tar and rsync, but implements all backup functions internally and uses a custom protocol to communicate with remote systems. Eliminating dependencies on tar and rsync allows for better handling of database-specific backup challenges. The custom remote protocol allows greater flexibility and limits the types of connections required to perform backups, thus improving security.

pgBackRest [v2.01](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest/releases/tag/release/2.01) is the current stable version. Release notes are available on the [releases](https://pgbackrest.org/release.html) page.

pgBackRest v1 will only receive bug fixes until EOL. v1 documentation can be found [here](http://www.pgbackrest.org/1).

## 0. Features

* Parallel Backup and Restore

  Compression is usually the bottleneck in backup operations, but even with today's common multi-core servers, most database backup solutions are still single-process. pgBackRest solves the compression bottleneck through parallel processing. Utilizing multiple cores for compression can achieve 1TB/hour native throughput even on 1Gb/s links. More cores and greater bandwidth will result in higher throughput.

* Local or Remote Operation

  The custom protocol allows pgBackRest to perform local or remote backup, restore, and archiving via SSH with minimal configuration. The protocol layer also provides an interface to query PostgreSQL, eliminating the need for remote PostgreSQL access, thus enhancing security.

* Full, Incremental, and Differential Backups

  Support for full backups, incremental backups, and differential backups. pgBackRest is not affected by rsync's time resolution issues, making differential and incremental backups completely safe.

* Backup Rotation and Archive Expiration

  Retention policies can be set for full and incremental backups to create backups covering any time range. WAL archiving can be set to retain for all backups or only recent backups. In the latter case, consistency of older backups is automatically ensured during the archiving process.

* Backup Integrity

  Each file is checksummed during backup and rechecked during restore. After completing file copies, backup waits for all necessary WAL segments to enter the repository. Backups in the repository are stored in the same format as a standard PostgreSQL cluster (including tablespaces). If compression is disabled and hard links are enabled, backups can be snapshotted in the repository and PostgreSQL clusters can be directly created on the snapshots. This is advantageous for TB-scale databases where traditional restoration would be time-consuming. All operations use file and directory-level fsync to ensure durability.

* Page Checksums

  PostgreSQL supports page-level checksums starting from 9.3. If page checksums are enabled, pgBackRest will verify checksums for every file copied during backup. All page checksums are verified during full backup, and checksums in changed files are verified during differential and incremental backups.
  Verification failures won't stop the backup process but will output detailed warnings about which pages failed verification to console and file logs.

  This feature allows early detection of page-level corruption before backups containing valid data copies expire.

* Backup Resume

  Aborted backups can be resumed from the stopping point. Already copied files will be compared against checksums in the manifest to ensure integrity. Since this operation can be performed entirely on the backup server, it reduces load on the database server and saves time, as checksum calculation is faster than compression and retransmission.

* Streaming Compression and Checksums

  Whether the repository is local or remote, compression and checksum calculation are performed in-stream while files are being copied to the repository.
  If the repository is on a backup server, compression is performed on the database server and files are transmitted in compressed format and stored on the backup server. When compression is disabled, lower-level compression is utilized to efficiently use available bandwidth while minimizing CPU cost.

* Delta Restore

  The manifest contains checksums for every file in the backup, so these checksums can be used to speed up the restore process. During delta restore, any files not present in the backup are first deleted, then checksums are performed on the remaining files. Files matching the backup are left in place, while the rest are restored normally. Parallel processing can lead to dramatically reduced restore times.

* Parallel WAL Push

  Includes dedicated commands to push WAL to archive and retrieve WAL from archive. The push command automatically detects multiple WAL segment pushes and automatically deduplicates if segments are identical, otherwise raises an error. Both push and get commands ensure database and repository match by comparing PostgreSQL version and system identifiers. This eliminates the possibility of misconfiguring WAL archive location.
  Asynchronous archiving allows transferring to another process that parallelly compresses WAL segments for maximum throughput. This can be a critical feature for very high write-volume databases.

* Tablespace and Link Support

  Full support for tablespaces, and restore can remap tablespaces to any location. There's also a command useful for development recovery that remaps all tablespaces to one location.

* Amazon S3 Support

  pgBackRest repository can be stored on Amazon S3 for virtually unlimited capacity and retention.

* Encryption

  pgBackRest can encrypt repositories to protect backups regardless of where they're stored.

* Compatible with PostgreSQL >= 8.3

  pgBackRest includes support for versions below 8.3 since older PostgreSQL versions are still frequently used.

## 1. Introduction

This user guide is designed to be read sequentially from start to finish, with each section building on the previous. For example, the "Backup" section relies on setup performed in the "Quick Start" section.

While examples target Debian/Ubuntu and PostgreSQL 9.4, applying this guide to any Unix distribution and PostgreSQL version should be fairly straightforward. Note that only 64-bit distributions are currently supported due to 64-bit operations in the Perl code. The only OS-specific commands are those for creating, starting, stopping, and deleting PostgreSQL clusters. pgBackRest commands are identical on any Unix system, though installation locations for Perl libraries and executables may vary.

PostgreSQL configuration information and documentation can be found in the PostgreSQL manual.

This user guide adopts some novel documentation approaches. When generating documentation from XML sources, every command is executed on virtual machines. This means you can have high confidence that commands work correctly in the order presented. Output is captured and displayed below commands when appropriate. If output isn't included, it's because it's considered irrelevant or distracting from the narrative.

All commands are run as a non-privileged user with sudo access to both root and postgres users. Commands can also be run directly as respective users without modification, in which case the sudo commands can be stripped.

## 2. Concepts

### 2.1 Backup

A backup is a consistent copy of a database cluster that can be used to recover from hardware failure, perform point-in-time recovery, or start a new standby database.

* Full Backup

  pgBackRest copies all files in the database cluster to the backup server. The first backup of a database cluster is always a full backup.

  pgBackRest can always restore directly from a full backup. Full backup consistency doesn't depend on any external files.

* Differential Backup

  pgBackRest only copies database cluster files whose contents have changed since the last full backup. During restore, pgBackRest copies all files from the differential backup plus all unchanged files from the previous full backup. The advantage of differential backup is it requires less disk space than full backup, the disadvantage is differential backup restoration depends on the validity of the previous full backup.

* Incremental Backup

  pgBackRest only copies database cluster files that have changed since the last backup (which could be another incremental backup, differential backup, or full backup). Since incremental backups only contain files changed since the last backup, they're typically much smaller than full or differential backups. Like differential backups, incremental backups depend on other backups for valid restoration. Since incremental backups only contain files since the last backup, all previous incremental backups back to the previous differential, the previous differential backup, and the previous full backup must all be valid to perform incremental backup restoration. If no differential backup exists, all previous incremental backups back to the previous full backup (which must exist) and the full backup itself must be valid to restore the incremental backup.

### 2.2 Restore

Restore is the act of copying backups to a system that will be started as a live database cluster. Restore requires backup files and one or more WAL segments to work properly.

### 2.3 WAL

WAL is the mechanism PostgreSQL uses to ensure no committed changes are lost. Transactions are written sequentially to WAL, and transactions are considered committed when these writes are flushed to disk. Later, a background process writes changes to the main database cluster files (also called heap). In case of crash, WAL is replayed to keep the database consistent.

WAL is conceptually infinite but in practice is broken down into separate 16MB files called segments. WAL segments follow the naming convention `0000000100000A1E000000FE`, where the first 8 hex digits represent timeline, the next 16 digits are the logical sequence number (LSN).

### 2.4 Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting data into an unrecognizable format unless the appropriate password (also called passphrase) is provided.

pgBackRest will encrypt repositories based on user-provided passwords, preventing unauthorized access to repository data.

## 3. Installation

### Short Version

```bash
# CentOS
sudo yum install -y pgbackrest

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libdbd-pg-perl libio-socket-ssl-perl libxml-libxml-perl
```

### Verbose Version

Create a new host called db-primary to contain the demo cluster and run pgBackRest examples.
If pgBackRest is already installed, it's best to ensure no previous versions are installed. Depending on the pgBackRest version, it may have been installed in several different locations. The following commands will remove all previous versions of pgBackRest.

* db-primary⇒Remove previous pgBackRest installations

```bash
sudo rm -f /usr/bin/pgbackrest
sudo rm -f /usr/bin/pg_backrest
sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/perl5/BackRest
sudo rm -rf /usr/share/perl5/BackRest
sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/perl5/pgBackRest
sudo rm -rf /usr/share/perl5/pgBackRest
```

pgBackRest is written in Perl, which is included by default in Debian/Ubuntu. Some additional modules must also be installed, but they're available as standard packages.

* db-primary⇒Install required Perl packages

```bash
# CentOS
sudo yum install -y pgbackrest

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libdbd-pg-perl libio-socket-ssl-perl libxml-libxml-perl
```

Debian/Ubuntu packages for pgBackRest are available at [apt.postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/). If none are available for your distribution/version, source code can be easily downloaded and manually installed.

* db-primary⇒Download pgBackRest version 2.01

```bash
sudo wget -q -O- \
       https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest/archive/release/2.01.tar.gz | \
       sudo tar zx -C /root
       
# or without sudo
wget -q -O - https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest/archive/release/2.01.tar.gz | tar zx -C /tmp
```

* db-primary⇒Install pgBackRest

```bash
sudo cp -r /root/pgbackrest-release-2.01/lib/pgBackRest \
       /usr/share/perl5
sudo find /usr/share/perl5/pgBackRest -type f -exec chmod 644 {} +
sudo find /usr/share/perl5/pgBackRest -type d -exec chmod 755 {} +
sudo mkdir -m 770 /var/log/pgbackrest
sudo chown postgres:postgres /var/log/pgbackrest
sudo touch /etc/pgbackrest.conf
sudo chmod 640 /etc/pgbackrest.conf
sudo chown postgres:postgres /etc/pgbackrest.conf

sudo cp -r /root/pgbackrest-release-1.27/lib/pgBackRest \
       /usr/share/perl5
sudo find /usr/share/perl5/pgBackRest -type f -exec chmod 644 {} +
sudo find /usr/share/perl5/pgBackRest -type d -exec chmod 755 {} +

sudo cp /root/pgbackrest-release-1.27/bin/pgbackrest /usr/bin/pgbackrest
sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/pgbackrest
sudo mkdir -m 770 /var/log/pgbackrest
sudo chown postgres:postgres /var/log/pgbackrest
sudo touch /etc/pgbackrest.conf
sudo chmod 640 /etc/pgbackrest.conf
sudo chown postgres:postgres /etc/pgbackrest.conf
```

pgBackRest includes an optional companion C library that can enhance performance and enable the `checksum-page` option and encryption. Pre-built packages are usually better than manually building the C library, but for completeness, the required steps are given below. Some packages may be required depending on the distribution, not exhaustively listed here.

* db-primary⇒Build and install C library

```bash
sudo sh -c 'cd /root/pgbackrest-release-2.01/libc && \
       perl Makefile.PL INSTALLMAN1DIR=none INSTALLMAN3DIR=none'
sudo make -C /root/pgbackrest-release-2.01/libc test
sudo make -C /root/pgbackrest-release-2.01/libc install
```

Now pgBackRest should be properly installed, but it's good to verify. If any dependencies are missing, you'll get an error when running pgBackRest from the command line.

* db-primary⇒Ensure installation is working

```bash
sudo -u postgres pgbackrest

## 4. Quick Start

### 4.1 Setting Up Demo Database Cluster

Creating the sample cluster is optional but strongly recommended for new users since example commands in the user guide reference the sample cluster. Examples assume the demo cluster is running on the default port (i.e., 5432). The cluster won't be started until later sections since there's still some configuration to do.

* db-primary⇒Create demo cluster

```bash
# create database cluster
pg_ctl init -D /var/lib/pgsql/data

# change listen address to *
sed -ie "s/^#listen_addresses = 'localhost'/listen_addresses = '*'/g" /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf

# change log prefix 
sed -ie "s/^#log_line_prefix = '%m [%p] '/log_line_prefix = ''/g" /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf
```

By default, PostgreSQL only accepts local connections. This example needs connections from other servers, so listen_addresses is configured to listen on all ports. This may be inappropriate if security requirements exist.

For demonstration purposes, log_line_prefix setting is configured minimally. This keeps log output as brief as possible to better illustrate important information.

### 4.2 Configure Cluster Stanza

A stanza is a set of configuration about a PostgreSQL database cluster that defines database location, how to backup, archiving options, etc. Most database servers have only one Postgres database cluster, so only one stanza, while backup servers have one stanza for each database cluster needing backup.

It's tempting to name the stanza after the primary cluster, but a better name describes the databases contained in the cluster. Since stanza names will be used for primary and all replicas, choosing names describing actual cluster function (like app or dw) rather than local cluster names (like main or prod) would be more appropriate.

"Demo" accurately describes this database cluster's purpose, so we'll use it.

pgBackRest needs to know where the PostgreSQL cluster's **data directory** is located. PostgreSQL can use this directory during backup, but must be shut down during restore. During backup, the value provided to pgBackRest will be compared with the path PostgreSQL is running, and backup will error if they're not equal. Ensure `db-path` matches `data_directory` in `postgresql.conf` exactly.

By default, Debian/Ubuntu stores clusters in /var/lib/postgresql/[version]/[cluster], making it easy to determine the correct data directory path.

When creating the `/etc/pgbackrest.conf` file, the database owner (usually postgres) must be granted read permissions.

* db-primary: `/etc/pgbackrest.conf`⇒Configure PostgreSQL cluster data directory

```ini
[demo]
db-path=/var/lib/pgsql/data
```

pgBackRest configuration files follow Windows INI conventions. Sections are indicated by text in brackets, with each section containing key/value pairs. Lines beginning with `#` are ignored and can be used as comments.

### 4.3 Create Repository

Repository is where pgBackRest stores backups and archived WAL segments.

New backups are hard to estimate space requirements in advance. The best approach is to perform some backups, record sizes of different backup types (full/incr/diff), and measure daily WAL production. This will give you a rough idea of needed space. Requirements may change over time as the database grows.

For this demo, the repository will be stored on the same host as the PostgreSQL server. This is the simplest configuration and very useful when using traditional backup software to back up the database host.

* db-primary⇒Create pgBackRest repository

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/lib/pgbackrest
sudo chmod 750 /var/lib/pgbackrest
sudo chown postgres:postgres /var/lib/pgbackrest
```

Repository path must be configured so pgBackRest knows where to find it.

* db-primary: `/etc/pgbackrest.conf` ⇒Configure pgBackRest repository path

```ini
[demo]
db-path=/var/lib/postgresql/9.4/demo

[global]
repo-path=/var/lib/pgbackrest
```

### 4.4 Configure Archiving

Backing up a running PostgreSQL cluster requires enabling WAL archiving. Note that at least one WAL segment will be created during backup even if no explicit writes are made to the cluster.

* db-primary: `/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf`⇒ Configure archive settings

```ini
archive_command = 'pgbackrest --stanza=demo archive-push %p'
archive_mode = on
listen_addresses = '*'
log_line_prefix = ''
max_wal_senders = 3
wal_level = hot_standby
```

The wal_level setting must be at least `archive`, but `hot_standby` and `logical` also work for backups. In PostgreSQL 10, the corresponding wal_level is `replica`. Setting wal_level to hot_standby and increasing max_wal_senders is a good idea even if you're not currently running hot standby databases, as this allows adding them without restarting the primary cluster. The PostgreSQL cluster must be restarted after making these changes and before performing backups.

### 4.5 Retention Configuration

pgBackRest will expire backups based on retention configuration.

* db-primary: `/etc/pgbackrest.conf`  ⇒ Configure to retain two full backups

```ini
[demo]
db-path=/var/lib/postgresql/9.4/demo

[global]
repo-path=/var/lib/pgbackrest

retention-full=2
```

More information about retention can be found in the `Retention` section.

### 4.6 Configure Repository Encryption

The stanza-create command must be run on the host where the repository is located to initialize the stanza. Running the check command after stanza-create is recommended to ensure archiving and backup are configured correctly.

* db-primary: `/etc/pgbackrest.conf`  ⇒ Configure pgBackRest repository encryption

```ini
[demo]
db-path=/var/lib/postgresql/9.4/demo

[global]
repo-cipher-pass=zWaf6XtpjIVZC5444yXB+cgFDFl7MxGlgkZSaoPvTGirhPygu4jOKOXf9LO4vjfO
repo-cipher-type=aes-256-cbc
repo-path=/var/lib/pgbackrest
retention-full=2
```

Once the repository is configured and stanza is created and checked, repository encryption settings cannot be changed.

### 4.7 Create Stanza

The `stanza-create` command must be run on the host where the repository is located to initialize the stanza. Running the `check` command after `stanza-create` is recommended to ensure archiving and backup are configured correctly.

* db-primary  ⇒ Create stanza and check configuration

```bash
postgres$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo --log-level-console=info stanza-create

P00   INFO: stanza-create command begin 1.27: --db1-path=/var/lib/postgresql/9.4/demo --log-level-console=info --no-log-timestamp --repo-cipher-pass= --repo-cipher-type=aes-256-cbc --repo-path=/var/lib/pgbackrest --stanza=demo

P00   INFO: stanza-create command end: completed successfully
```
